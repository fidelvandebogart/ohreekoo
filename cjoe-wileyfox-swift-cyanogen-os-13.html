                            <p>Description I tagged a user, and couldn't figure out how to remove it, so I went to the Tag User option in the profile view, deleted the contents, and clicked the save tag button. The app crashed, and refused to load any more pages after this until I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Scenario (steps to reproduce) 1. Tag a user on their profile page. 2. Close the profile page 3. Re-open the profile 4. Go to the Tag User option in the menu. 5. Delete the content CyanogenMod (/ s aɪ ˈ æ n oʊ dʒ ɛ n m ɒ d / sy-AN-o-jen-mod; CM) is a discontinued open-source operating system for mobile devices, based on the Android mobile platform. It was developed as free and open-source software based on the official releases of Android by Google, with added original and third-party code, and based on a rolling release development model. So I'm currently running Cyanogen 13.1 on my Wileyfox Swift 1 and I don't want to update to Android 7 cause I've heard it kills the battery and you lose some features. So that leaves Lineage OS. Is it worth wiping the phone to unlock the bootloader and and flash it? Reinstalling everything would Product Overview The Wileyfox Swift 2 is an affordable Android OS based Dual Sim slot smartphone phone packed with useful specs and features such as a fingerprint sensor scanner on the rear of the device as well as Near Field Communication (NFC) and Gorilla Glass v3 protection at a price point that just about everyone can afford. 
OOPS! I made a mistake in the title, this is a list for phones UNDER 0 , not gt0 as the title suggests. Let's try something new. For 4 years now, we've gathered the Best High end Android Phones (https://www.reddit.com/r/PickAnAndroidForMe/comments/3ptuy8/2015s_high_end_androids/) and created a list to make it easy to see all your options and compare them in one place (while trying to keep the bias out of it). The high end list is easy, because they're pretty much the same across. Devices Rows with a lower opacity are no longer officially supported and the pages exist for reference only. You can hide them by unchecking the following checkbox. Completely unplanned as I didn't have any issues with the standard Nougat 7.1.2 apart from Truecaller but I had a sudden urge to install TWRP. Used adb and as I exited the first use of TWRP it gave me the "No OS" message which was a bit of a surprise. Looked online for help and read dozens of frankly contradictory pages and watched a few useless Youtube videos with shockingly loud music and very little content. Got hold of the Lineage 14.1 rom and flashed, this resulted In case you have heard of the term Lineage OS and wondered what does it mean, but don’t actually know what it is, know that it is a custom ROM made by the same team that developed the CyanogenMod ROM and the Cyanogen OS, but the Cyanogen OS was discontinued, and Lineage OS is technically its successor. Ok, so I clean flashed LineageOS 14.1 last week from CyanogenOS 13.1 on my Wileyfox Swift (1st Gen). No issues with the system, fast and smooth. Unfortunately I have run into nothing but errors when trying to update to the latest available nightly. Earlier this week I tried, but it gave a zip signature failed (I assumed that was just our internet being dodgy) but today when I tried to update to a (now different) latest nightly I ran into an Error 7 in TWRP. I have tried several times, manually. Lineage OS is now official and the official builds will be available later this year. Here's a single page for Lineage OS ROM downloads & build status. Lately I've been getting a lot of notifications saying my storage space is running out. Uninstalled some apps to fix it. A while later the same messages. So I got a micro SD card and migrated all the data that I could to there. A while later the same notifications. I try deleting as much as I could, but I keep having storage issues. My phone is a Wileyfox Swift running android 6.0.1 and CyanogenOS 13.1.5-ZNH2KAS7EB-crackling. When looking in to my storage, to me it looks like I should Warner Bros ha diffuso un nuovo trailer per Lego Dimensions che, questa volta, vede protagonisti Scooby-Doo e Shaggy della Mystery Inc. in un originale mix tra cartone animato…. 
Hi there, Just got Cortana in the UK and I want to replace the home buttons action. When I long press I don't get an option to change default and I tried looking for somewhere to reset it in settingsgtapps but no joy. The Google App has no "open by default" settings. I am on CyanogenOS 13 on a WileyFox Swift. This is what I want to be able to do: Thanks Has anyone else noticed that switching EQs in AudioFX isn't as smooth in LineageOS as in CyanogenOS/Cyanogenmod? I have a Wileyfox Swift (crackling) and was previously running CyanogenOS 13.1 before I switched to Lineage in about February, and I think it's worth pointing out that since I upgraded the animations within the AudioFX app stutter slightly. A very tiny issue, I know, but I like to use this cool feature to show Lineage off to friends and the stuttering just doesn't Hi there, I really like Shuttle but there's just one little bug (or series of bugs) that keeps occuring. I have a collection of music from multiple sources, some from iTunes (m4a), some from mp3 files. All of these files are stored on my sdcard in folders organised in /sdcard/Music/ltartistgt/ltalbumgt/ltsonggt format. All the music appears and plays fine with Shuttle, but some mp3 files appear as Unknown Artist/Album. The tag editor within Shuttle doe not save edits to these files. A common suggestion for Cyanogenmod is an implementation of something similar to Samsung's Ultra Power Save mode. However, as this as not been added, a simple alternative can be made through CM's System Profiles feature. In setting this up today I noticed that there is no option to change Battery Mode on a per profile basis. There are options to reduce brightness, change network type and disable WiFi etc, but to put the battery into Power Save mode, a separate menu must be opened. Could Anyone else's pokemon menu have massive fps issues and input lag. Seems to be common on the motarola G and samsung androids. I got a wileyfox swift after my last phone died and i'm wondering if there's anything I can do to boost the performance of this game on the phone. I'm running Cyanogen OS 13 at factory settings pretty much. Thanks for any help in advance. Hi there, I'm having the well documented issues with my profiles not firing until my screen is on and unlocked. I'm a long-term tasker user and would frankly have an apple device if tasked didn't exist for android. Anyone got it working properly?
